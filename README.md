# Synthesized-Anthropometric-Data
Repository containing specific population anthropometric data sets which are predicted and syntesized based on other comprehensive anthropometric data. See more info for each population data set.

## Anthropometric data sources 
### CHNS (Chinese) data:
This research uses public data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). URL: [https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china]

We are grateful to research grant funding from the National Institute for Health (NIH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) for R01 HD30880 and R01 HD38700, National Institute on Aging (NIA) for R01 AG065357, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) for R01 DK104371 and P30 DK056350, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for R01 HL108427, the NIH Fogarty grant D43 TW009077, the Carolina Population Center for P2C HD050924 and P30 AG066615 since 1989, and the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health for support for CHNS 2009, Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai since 2009, and Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Prevention and Control since 2011. We thank the National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai.

**Note:** From the CHNS data Age, Stature (body height), Body mass (weight), Waist circumference, and Hip Circumference (Maximum) of each individual was used to predict and synthesize missing data using a method described in Brolin et al. (2017). The predictions for the CHNS data set were based on data from ANSUR (Gordon et al., 1989), CAESAR (Robinette et al., 2002) and (Hanson et al., 2009).
